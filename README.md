HarvardX PH125.4x ; Data Science: Infering and Modeling


This is the fourth in a series of courses in the Professional Certificate in Data Science program. The courses in the Professional Certificate program are designed to prepare you to do data analysis in R, from simple computations to machine learning. We recommend that you complete the first three courses in the series (Data Science: R Basics, Data Science: Visualization, and Data Science: Probability) before taking this course.

This course assumes you are comfortable with basic math, algebra, logical operations, and probability, and that you have some R coding experience, such as that gained through earlier courses in this series.

HarvardX has partnered with DataCamp for some assignments in R that allow you to program directly in a browser-based interface. There are also some assignments that require a local installation of R.

Using a combination of a guided introduction through short video lectures and more independent in-depth exploration, you will get to practice your new R skills on real-life applications.

Statistical inference and modeling are indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists. In this course, you will learn these key concepts through a motivating case study on election forecasting.

This course will show you how inference and modeling can be applied to develop the statistical approaches that make polls an effective tool and we'll show you how to do this using R. You will learn concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors and learn how you can use these to make predictions relatively well and also provide an estimate of the precision of your forecast.

Once you learn this you will be able to understand two concepts that are ubiquitous in data science: confidence intervals and p-values. 

Finally, to understand statements about the probability of a candidate winning, you will learn about Bayesian modeling. At the end of the course, we will put it all together to recreate a simplified version of an election forecast model and apply it to the 2016 US presidential election.

This course builds upon probability theory, covered in the previous course in this series.

The class notes for this course series can be found in Professor Irizarry's freely available Introduction to Data Science book External link. The textbook is also freely available in PDF format on Leanpub External link. The textbook is also available in Spanish External link on Leanpub.

This course corresponds to the textbook chapters Statistical Inference External link and Statistical Models External link.

In this course, you will learn:

* The concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors of populations, parameters, estimates, and standard errors in order to make predictions about data.
* How to use models to aggregate data from different sources
* The very basics of Bayesian statistics and predictive modeling
